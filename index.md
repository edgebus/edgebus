EdgeBus is a library and standalone server application that makes your life easy in integration of different systems and make development a fun and easy experience.

There are two main goals:
* **Asynchronous Messages** - manage, audit, transform, guarantee delivery
* **Synchronous Calls** - audit, transform, retry

## Asynchronous Messages

Basically, these days, mostly each project requires to receive and deliver asynchronous messages with external systems.
There are a lot of terrible parts to handle this task such a guaranteed delivery, audit, manage event endpoints.

EdgeBus provides set of features in scope related to Asynchronous Messages:

* Audit messages and delivery evidences
* Performance counters
* Delivery retry policy
* [Protocol switching]({{ "/glossary/#protocol-switching" | relative_url }})
* Transform payload
* Manual retry message delivery

Unfortunately, a lot of developers have thoughts the external system always available and network always no issues.

EdgeBus provides set of features in scope related to Synchronous Calls:

* Performance counters
* [Protocol switching]({{ "/glossary/#protocol-switching" | relative_url }})
